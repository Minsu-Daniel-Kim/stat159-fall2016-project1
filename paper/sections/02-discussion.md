# 2. Discussion
This section discusses my personal experience on dealing with these tools introduced above. Therefore, this content is meant to be self-reflective.

## 2.1 Resources I used
Because these tools are well known and widely used tools, there are a lot of tutorials and documentations on Internet. I first read Wikipedia and introductory articles in official websites to understand the basic core concepts about these tools. Also, there are a lot of easy-to-follow tutorials that provide a step-by-step procedure from installation to basic commands. 

## 2.2 Easy parts
I have already been exposed to Makefile, Git and GitHub from my computer science courses. Thus, using these tools is very natural and easy for me. 

## 2.3 Challenging parts
When I first encountered these concepts such as branching, merging and pushing, it took me a while to digest. One of things that help me understand during that time was to use visualizations to understand the workflow graphically. Also, since I did not often use makefiles, I had to go over some tutorials to get used to both syntax and structure.

## 2.4 Time consuming parts
Installation was very straightforward and easy, and some of them are pre-installed in OSX. Time consuming part was to make a well-formatted markdown file. It involved a trial and error process. But overall, everything was quite intuitive and thanks to the tutorials, I could seamlessly go through all parts.

## 2.5 How much time I spent
I spent eight hours in total. To decompose the time I spent, 1) 1 hour to install all the relevant programs. 2) 2 hours to go over concepts. 3) 2 hours to have a hands-on experience. 4) 3 hours to write a report.
