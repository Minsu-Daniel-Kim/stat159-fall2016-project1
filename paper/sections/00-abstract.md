# Abstract

Due to the recent advent of open-source and collaborative paradigm, sharing and collaborating in IT engineering sectors have been blooming, which consequentially contribute to the breakthrough of the overall productivity and efficiency in industry. This recent trend also has influenced on academic research schemes. That is, the reproducibility is highly emphasized in addition to the result of the research. Bringing in the notion of reproducibility to academic research not only helps to publicize his or her work easily but also provides a means to do a sanity check on his or her work. In this paper, I present five fundamental tools that make reproducible workflow easy and efficient.
